and freelancers online tools to manage their on-demand projects.  Bonsai offers two distinct products – one
designed uniquely for freelancers to more easily manage the contract,
invoicing, payment, and reporting aspects of their business (“Freelance
Services”) – and the other designed specifically for companies to more
efficiently manage the onboarding, sourcing, project management, invoicing,
payment and reporting requirements needed to utilize an external workforce (“Client Services”). </p><p>Bonsai’s Services are always evolving and may change from
time to time without notice. Bonsai may cease or suspend Services (or any
Services feature) at any time in its sole and absolute discretion. New features
introduced by Bonsai will also be subject to these Terms of Services.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>2. </strong><strong>General Rules About Creating Accounts</strong> </p><p><strong>Eligibility</strong>:  To be eligible to create an account, you must

their password or account secure. </p><p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: You are
