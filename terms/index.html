                     <div class="faq-title">YOUR TRADING ACCOUNT AND THE BANK ACCOUNT:</div>
                     <p class="faq-paragraph">Once we receive your application, we may run checks, including credit and/or other checks as we find suitable any time, which includes without any hindrance, getting references from your bank, credit agencies, and/or employer wherever applicable. Whether your application was successful or not, the credit reference agency will maintain a record of the search. As long as this Agreement is active, we have the authority to run extra credit checks at any time.

a. You confirm and agree that we have the authority to determine your credit score and use it in evaluating your application. This action may determine if we will accept, reject, or modify the operational terms of your Account.

b. You are under obligation to inform us at once, any time any of the information you provided in your Application Form changes.

c. If we accept your Application Form, we will create an Account for you and assign you an account number and a user ID. You are not authorised to share the details of your user ID and account number with anyone. If at any time, you believe that a third party has knowledge of this information, you should alert us at once. You have the duty to render assistance to us concerning the investigation of any improper or unauthorised use of your Account.

d. You acknowledge that we are not under any obligation to verify the identity of any person operating or making reference to your Account.

e. You acknowledge that we shall have the authority (but without any obligation) to pay all your owed monies into one account. We may (but without any obligation) accept to transfer funds to various Bank Accounts. Even though we accept to do so, we shall not bear the liability for any error we make in the sum transferred, as long as the total amount of money transferred following this Agreement is accurate.

f. Monies that are in Clients’ account may be a combination of voluntary or agreed incentives and bonuses. This may also include any other funds that are not direct deposits from the Client, or profits from trading with funds actually deposited in the account (Non-Deposited Monies). Kindly note that Non-Deposited Monies do not have the option for immediate withdrawal unless clearly agreed. In addition, because of technical restrictions, we may apply Non-Deposited Monies to Clients’ account under specific situation (for instance, in the event of an indebted account or the technical closure of open positions). PLEASE BE AWARE THAT NON-DEPOSITED MONIES, which include gains made on, or gotten from account are not the funds of the Client. Once there is a confirmation of the withdrawal of Non-Deposited Monies, Pro Speed Tech LTD shall have the total right to recover all such monies.

g. PRO SPEED TECH LTD is fully liable for all dues originating from the business and that the governing law is the law of the EU entity – UK&Wales.</p>

                     <div class="faq-title">ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS:</div>
                     <p class="faq-paragraph">In addition to the above, and without the limitation of the general features of this clause, you:

a. Acknowledge that the Bank Account information you provided is valid and complete and that you will inform us at once if any of them changes, and will readily provide us with any documents as requested by us in relation to the amended Bank Accounts.

b. Acknowledge that (except it was pre-agreed) the Bank Account refers to a bank account created in the country of your primary residence.

c. Confirm and accept that we are not obliged to execute transfer of any sum of money to, or accept any sum of money from other accounts that are not the Bank Account.

d. Apart from instances of fraud (not including third-party frauds), we will not bear the burden of any damage or loss you incur because of your trading activities, with monies credited to or deposited in your Account on our behalf or by mistake.

e. We have the authority at any time to terminate your Account with respect to the terms of this Agreement.

f. Confirm clearly that because of the volatility of the market, Pro Speed Tech LTD has the authority to adjust the level of allowable margin per any trade without any warning.

g. Multiple Accounts: If you own more than a single Account (unless otherwise clearly included in this Agreement), we will treat each Account separately. This means that all the credits on one Account (plus funds deposited as margin), will not offset your debts in another Account unless we execute our rights as contained in this Agreement.

h. Beneficiaries/Joint Accounts: Where an Account is under the ownership of a corporate organisation, company, corporation, partnership or any other group of multiple users, any withdrawal must have the approval of all signatories or beneficiaries of the Account..</p>
